Reader: Emily Meng, Recorder: Shiyu Qiu
Relevant functions: add_item(), remove_item()
Issues:
- User can’t delete item from bill that he/she does not own
- Different error messages given for same issues
- User should not be able to add duplicate items (causes database error)
- Should not use global variable to determine which user is editing bill
- User can’t add items with spaces in between (ex: french fries, chicken wings, etc)


Issues fixed:
- Should not use global variable to determine which user is editing bill
- Different error messages given for same issues
- User can’t edit/delete item from bill that he/she does not own (by eliminating edit/delete buttons for items the users don’t own)
- User should not be able to add duplicate items (by allowing users edit item’s quantity to prevent them from adding duplicate items multiple times)
